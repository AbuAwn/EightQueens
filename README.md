# [Eight Queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)
Solve the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard by graphing all fundamental solutions, where one fundamental solution represents all rotated and flipped versions.
 
1. You must install sbt and Scala, see [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) & [scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
1. Download source files from github:

`git clone https://github.com/AbuAwn/EightQueens.git`

3. execute sbt then run

Each board represents a fundamental solution, a version of one of 8 possible ways for the same, rotated or flipped, solution.
En total we have 96 possible solutions, that is, 12 fundamental version x 8 respective variants :
